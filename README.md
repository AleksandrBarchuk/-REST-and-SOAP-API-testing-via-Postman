# -REST-and-SOAP-API-testing-via-Postman

1) I tested all methods that are provided for  https://intern.demoshopping.ru/ in Postman and created the corresponding collections:   
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.postman.com/grey-eclipse-794752/workspace/homework/collection/40644676-e9540186-6efa-4711-b4b7-6d99a8e6e2ef?action=share&creator=40644676">CollectionsPostman</a> </li>
<li><a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yV__afdiIew4zVfuBX1fBllc_qoI5dT1h4oQWA7mcMc/edit?usp=sharing">Test cases for "store" block</a></li>
</ul>


2) Using the following WSDL, I created a working collection in Postman that can be used to determine: a country's currency, full country information, and country specific language information:

<li> <a href="https://www.postman.com/grey-eclipse-794752/soap-homework/collection/t2qf406/api-documentation?action=share&creator=40644676">Postamn collection: SOAP</a></li>
